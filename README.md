This repository contains the seminar project titled:

> **Deep Learning in Video Games: Reinforcement Learning, Procedural Content, and Real-Time Visual Metrics**

## ðŸ“„ Abstract

Deep learning is transforming video game development and gameplay by enabling intelligent agents, procedural content generation, and real-time personalization. Techniques like reinforcement learning, SimBa, and Residual-MPPI allow for scalable agent behavior, dynamic control, and adaptive experiences, making games more immersive, interactive, and strategic.

## ðŸ“Œ Seminar Overview

- Reinforcement Learning applications in gaming environments  
- Multi-agent learning and adaptive NPC behavior  
- Procedural content and narrative generation using neural models  
- SimBa: Simplicity-biased RL architecture  
- Residual-MPPI: Real-time control through hybrid models
